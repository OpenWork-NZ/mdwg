#  Class (abstract) - MD_Identification
*When capturing information on a spatial resource, it is important to identify and categorise information as pertaining to the data or service resource and to distinguish these information from that which applies to the metadata itself. MD_Identification provide a abstract package, the properties of which can be expressed for data (MD_DataIdentification) or service SV_ServiceIdentification) resources.*

- **Governance** -  *ISO*
- **Metadata Type -** *structural*
- *ICSM Level of Agreement* - â­‘

## Definition

**basic information required to uniquely identify a resource or resources.**

### ISO Requirements
At least one [1..\*] [MD_Identification](http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/MD_Identification)  must be present in a metadata record. This must be instantiated as a `MD_DataIdentification` or `SV_ServiceIdentification` instance.

### ISO Associations

**[MD_Identification](http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/MD_Identification)** is an abstract class that can be instantiated as either

- MD_DataIdentification
- SV_ServiceIdentification

It is a child of 

- MD_Metadata.identificationInfo

## Discussion

Identification information about a resource is of high importance to document as this information strongly impacts on the ability of a user to asses the resource fitness to use. The **identificationInfo** package must be of either type *data*  (*MD_DataIdentification*) or *service* (*SV_ServiceIdentification*).

## Recommendations 

There must be at least one (and usually just one) `identificationInfo` packages in a metadata record that contains the substantive  information about a cited resource.
