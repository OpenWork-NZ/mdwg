# Introduction

This guide is intended to provide a resource for those wishing to implement the AS/NZS ISO 19115.1:2015 metadata standard (including the 2018 Amendment No.1) in the Australia and New Zealand region. While this has been the officially endorsed metadata standard for Australia and New Zealand since 2015, consistency of implementation and the slow development of tools to support this standard have been problems. The development of this document has been undertaken to alleviate these issues and to provide a basis for further work.

This guide is meant to be a living document. At times it does not always provide strong guidance on the use of an element as [MDWG](https://www.icsm.gov.au/what-we-do/metadata-working-group) discussion about the element usage has need to continue and mature. This document is meant to evolve as use and understanding of the standard matures. It is meant to be an online active resource that can be referenced and grow as needed.

As we are human, absolute agreement about the use of the metadata and elements is not achievable.  But we can narrow the difference in understanding through the use of definitions and guidance.

## Background

On the 13th June 2018, the Australian and New Zealand, Location Information Metadata Working Group (ANZ MDWG) was re-established by request of the [ANZLIC](https://www.anzlic.gov.au/) â€“ the Spatial Information Council (ANZLIC) and the Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping ([ICSM](https://www.icsm.gov.au/)).

The working group will support a wider understanding and consistent application of location information metadata, based on agreed standards.

Terms of Reference

- Actively monitor and assess the impact of future changes to metadata standards, in order to advise ANZLIC on policy impacts and stakeholders on the scale and impact of technical changes, through the managed knowledge of current national capabilities in metadata.
- Create and maintain a roadmap documenting what the MDWG is going to undertake and when.
- Develop, and manage a series of best practice resources (profiles, applications, websites (ANZLIC and ICSM), FAQs, models) to assist both general and technical audiences in understanding, implementing and managing the latest versions of metadata standards.
- Engage with interested industry organisations (SIBA, ESRI, etc.) to communicate working group developments and directions.
- Provide advice to spatial communities on the value, implementation and management of metadata and associated systems.
- Provide a forum for metadata custodians to share and exchange knowledge related to implementing, maintaining and updating metadata frameworks.
- Provide a forum for inward and outward communication between international (ISO and OGC peak bodies), other interest groups (Australian Government Linked Data Working Group, GeoNetwork community of practice etc.) to inform and seek feedback from core foundation spatial data custodians.
- Govern associated metadata tools, models, vocabularies, and resources, which are published on by ICSM and or ANZLIC.
- Report to ICSM and ANZLIC on key activities, and metadata developments.
