# ICSM ISO19115-1 Metadata Good Practice Guide



## Introduction

This guide is intended to provide a resource for those wishing to implement the AS/NZS ISO 19115.1:2015 metadata standard (including the 2018 Amendment No.1) in the Australia and New Zealand region. While this has been the officially endorsed metadata standard for Australia and New Zealand since 2015, consistency of implementation and the slow development of tools to support this standard have been problems. The development of this document has been undertaken to alleviate these issues and to provide a basis for further work.

This guide is meant to be a living document. At times it does not always provide strong guidance on the use of an element as MDWG discussion about the element usage has need to continue and mature. This document is meant to evolve as use and understanding of the standard matures. It is meant to be an online active resource that can be referenced and grow as needed.

As we are human, absolute agreement about the use of the metadata and elements is not achievable.  But we can narrow the difference in understanding through the use of definitions and guidance.
